# ScRNA-Preprocessing
This repository contains scripts and tools for demultiplexing and alignment of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using Cell Ranger. It aims to streamline the preprocessing workflow, enabling efficient analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data.  

__rename_fastq__ : the script helps in organizing sequencing data files by standardizing their names based on specific criteria.  

__cellranger_demultiplexing__ : the script separates pooled single-cell RNA sequencing reads based on unique barcodes, enabling accurate identification and quantification of gene expression in individual cells.  

__cellranger_count__ : the script processes demultiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing data to produce gene expression matrices.
